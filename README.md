A few utilities based on [python-pushover](https://github.com/Thibauth/python-pushover) \*


You must have python-pushover installed and your api-token and user-key stored in ~/.pushoverrc


\* *N.B. Not to be confused with another pushover library for python, [pushover](https://github.com/laprice/pushover)*
